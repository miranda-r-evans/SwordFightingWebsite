    <h1>Belegarth Training Guide</h1>
    <h2>Or, How to "Git Gud" At Stick Tag</h2>
    
    <h3>The Basics</h3>
      <p>Belegarth is a medieval combat society in which 
      combatants use “boffer” swords to simulate combat. 
      It is often likened to Live Action Role Play, or LARP,
      and is indeed considered to be a LARP by some, but it 
      is primarily a sport with role-play, or RP, as a secondary focus. 
      This website focuses on the combat side of Belegarth. For the 
      rules please refer to the <a href="http://www.belegarth.com/getting-started/rules/">Book of War.</a></p>

    <h3>Where to Fight</h3>
      <p>To become a skilled warrior, you must learn and practice. Events 
      are a great way to meet top fighters from around the country who are usually
      happy to impart their knowledge. Large events typically have classes, as well
      as plenty of sparring opportunities for one on one teaching. Unfortunately, 
      there is not an up-to-date calendar of events, but your local practice should
      be able to give you information about upcoming events in your area.</p>
        
      <p>Practices serve as both a fun way to exercise and compete with your friends on
      the weekend, as well as the place to hone your skills. A typical practice consists
      of a few hours of team fights, with some one on one fights and water breaks mixed
      in. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.belegarth.com/getting-started/realm-locator/">Realm Locator</a> 
      to find your local practice, and be sure to check your practice’s Facebook page for the
      most up-to-date information.</p>

    <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>The three most important types of equipment to own
      in Belegarth are weapons, garb, and safety gear. Weapons
      can be made or bought. Please see the 
      <a href="http://geddon.org/Category:How_to_build">How To Build</a> 
      page for tutorials on construction. There are many vendors to 
      choose from, but <a href="https://www.gorgtech.com/">Gorg The Blacksmith</a>
      and <a href= "http://www.forgedfoam.com/">Forged Foam</a> are good places
      for a new fighter to start shopping. Garb can also be made or bought. 
      If you are on a budget, it is easy and cheap to make a simple tabard and
      wear sweatpants or scrubs. The <a href="http://geddon.org/Guild_Library">Guild Library</a>
      has some sewing tutorials. <a href="https://www.linengarb.com/">Linen Garb</a>
      has high quality garb if you are willing to spend some money. Safety gear is
      not required, but strongly recommended. Lacrosse or MMA gloves, knee pads,
      and good shoes are the most basic protection that everyone should have.</p>
